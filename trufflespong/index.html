<p>Our truffles, are excellent, high quality white chocolate truffles, sold for 2 Dippold Dollars each. These truffles are made from scratch, with our extra touch of love.</p>
<h3>Pong</h3>
<p>The pong is what makes us unique, it is a risk-reward game, where you can either play to get a free truffle, or you can play for money. The way that it is played is that we get a cup and you try to get a ping pong ball into it.</p>
